# kalender-events (ka'lɛndɐ, german for calendar) <img src="https://github.com/naimo84/kalender-events/blob/master/docs/logo.png" width="200" align="right" alt="kalender-events">

This Node module gets the events from an ical-URL, a caldav-server or from the iCloud.
Special thanks to Peter Braden (https://github.com/peterbraden/ical.js) and Jens Maus (https://github.com/jens-maus/node-ical) for the whole ical parsing code :+1:

## :question: Get Help

For bug reports and feature requests, open issues. :bug:

## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications _for free_! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

Thank you to all my backers!

### Become a backer

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:

- Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:
- **Crypto.&#65279;com** Use my referral link https://crypto.com/app/f2smbah8fm to sign up for Crypto.&#65279;com and we both get $25 USD :) 
- [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations] **PayPal**— You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:
